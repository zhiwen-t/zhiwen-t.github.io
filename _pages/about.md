I am an Associate Professor in the School of Information Science & Engineering, Yunnan University, China. My research interests include reinforcement learning, natural language processing, and information retrieval. 

Before joining Yunnan University, I was a research scientist at Meta. I gained my PhD degree from the department of computer science, Georgetown University. Prior to that, I obtained my bachelor degree from Beihang University, China.
